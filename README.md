# roundTracker
Golfing round tracker

## GETTING STARTED:

To launch the application, start in the backend folder and type in "rails s" to fire up the database. Once the server is running open up a new terminal tab (do not close the backend) and change directories to the frontend folder and type in "open index.html". A web browser should launch, you are now in Round Tracker

## NAVIGATING: 

The application is fairly straightforward and is built to be used by one person trying to track all of their golf rounds, and have insights on the lifetime of their performance. To start, either signup or login if you already have an account. You must be logged in to use the app. Putting your name in and pressing signup will automatically log you in as well. 

Once logged in you can follow the tabs on the top to perform different tasks. The "create new round" page will be rendered by default and you will simply put in your score as you move through the golf round. 

At the  end of the round you will receive a summary score card, you can access all your scorecards in the "previous rounds" tab located at the top. 

Analytics will allow the user to see information about them as an individual i.e. how many pars, birdies, bogeys etc., and course and round specific information. To update or delete a round the user has the option to do so at any point on the score cards. 

## BUILT WITH:

Rails, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Bootstrap
